<p>When i first came to the museum I thought it wouldnt be fun and we would all be writing on paper and it would be boring. But now we have started to use computers to use photoshop and that is what i enjoy doing.</p>
  <p>The object I brought in was my phone that had a photograph of a painting of me and my dad fishing. The way it is linked to the group of bowls is the group of bowls that i chose were found at the bottom of the ocean. The way they are linked is me and my dad were fishing and fish live in the ocean so that is how they are linked. The reason why this is important is because in the painting i was with my dad and we were having fun so it was a fun day and it means alot to me.</p>
      <p>This is what i designed last lesson
